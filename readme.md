# Overview
Jupyter Notebooks are provided to provide executable documentation for 4 different approaches to anomaly detection.

There is also a script [AD_3_using_resnet_backbone_multilevel_inference.py](./AD_3_using_resnet_backbone_multilevel_inference.py) that focusses on running inference with the-ore.trained model.
